# Social Network API

## Description
This project presents an API for a social network web application, designed to enable users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage a friend list. Developed using Express.js for efficient routing, MongoDB as a scalable NoSQL database, and Mongoose ODM for easy data modeling and interaction, this API supports a dynamic and large-scale social networking environment. Optional use of a JavaScript date library or the native JavaScript Date object enhances timestamp formatting for user interactions.

## User Story
**AS A** social media startup  
**I WANT** an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database  
**SO THAT** my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** a social network API
- **WHEN** I enter the command to invoke the application, **THEN** my server is started, and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
- **WHEN** I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, **THEN** the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- **WHEN** I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, **THEN** I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
- **WHEN** I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia for reactions to thoughts and friends to a userâ€™s friend list, **THEN** I am able to successfully create and delete reactions and manage friends.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
